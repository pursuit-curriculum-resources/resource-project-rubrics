# Project Rubrics Resource

This repository contains rubrics for projects within the Core program.

Each project that includes a formal presentation to instructors will make use of the Presentation rubric.

- [Presentation rubric](./presentation.md)

Each project that is a group project will make use of the Teamwork rubric.

- [Teamwork rubric](./teamwork.md)

Each project will also make use of a Mastery rubric. Those rubrics will change depending on the unit the project is within.
