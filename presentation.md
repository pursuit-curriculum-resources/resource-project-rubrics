### Presentation rubric

This section of the project is designed to measure your ability to present your project and your code. These skills are crucial for succeeding in the course and getting your first job as a software developer.

You should aim to score _Proficient_ on all of the criteria listed below. Each rating on the scale, from Developing to Exemplary, is worth 1 point.
