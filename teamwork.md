### Teamwork rubric

This section of the project is designed to measure your ability to work with others to produce a software project. These skills are crucial for succeeding in the course and succeeding on the job as a software developer.

You should aim to score _Proficient_ on all of the criteria listed below. Each rating on the scale, from Developing to Exemplary, is worth 1 point.
