# Mastery rubric

This section of the project is designed to measure your increasing skill at writing good code and following best practices.

You should aim to score _Proficient_ on all of the criteria listed below. Each rating on the scale, from Developing to Exemplary, is worth 1 point.

## Project design

| Rating     | Points | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Novice     | 1      | The project is either unaligned to standard conventions or is too reliant on difficult to read, verbose files.                                                                                |
| Developing | 2      | The project is largely aligned to standard conventions, although more could be done to split up particularly long or multi-purpose files.                                                     |
| Proficient | 3      | The project follows standard conventions for that type of project. JavaScript files are not too long, and appropriate care is taken to split code up into well-named and sensible files.      |
| Exemplary  | 4      | The project is architected like a professional software development project. Files are thoughtful segmented and there are clear program design choices that have been implemented throughout. |

### Example

Scoring _proficient_ in this standard means that the project structure follows best practices and does not contain bloated files or folders. For example, a _proficient_ HTML & CSS project could include multiple CSS files in a `styles/` folder that are related to particular pages or parts of the page. For a React project, a _proficient_ score may look more like well-defined components and appropriately lifted state.

## Interface design

| Rating     | Points | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Novice     | 1      | The application is largely unusable without guidance from the developer or the website has a poor design that needs visual improvement.                                                                                                                                     |
| Developing | 2      | The large majority of the application works as expected but has some confusing interactions. Alternatively or additionally, the website is sufficiently well-designed but lacks polish.                                                                                     |
| Proficient | 3      | A user is able to interact with the application with minimal to no obvious errors or mistakes. Any errors that occur display a user-facing message. The website looks well-made and intentional.                                                                            |
| Exemplary  | 4      | A user is able to interact with the application with no obvious errors or mistakes. Any errors that occur display a helpful user-facing message that is inline with the design of the application. The design of the application is above average and appears professional. |

### Example

An _exemplary_ web application would look and feel nearly indistinguishable from commonly used websites such as LinkedIn or YouTube. A _proficient_ web application will still be quite good, but may have simple errors that use `alert()`-style messaging or some confusing interactions. A _proficient_ web application should also have a clean and understandable design.
